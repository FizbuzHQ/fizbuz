# Fizbuz Docs

The Docs here will focus less on the usage of the Fizbuz web application and more on the core data types that are supported and the APIs (REST and GraphQL) that power the web experience and are available to Fizbuz developers for their own use.

* [Data Types](data_types.md)
* [REST API](rest_api.md)
* [GraphQL API](graphql_api.md)
