# Fizbuz

Fizbuz helps developers create a profile that displays preferred languages, web frameworks, mobile platforms, cloud providers, CI tools, any kind of skill that you think is relevant to the work you do as a developer. You can also talk about non-technical skills, workplace preferences and anything else that helps tell a clear story about what a you have done, what you're capable of doing and how you want to grow. Think of Fizbuz as a replacement for a PDF resume or a LinkedIn profile.

Fizbuz is for developers, by developers.
