# Fizbuz

We are building a safe and inclusive professional networking site for developers. It won't just help you get your next job, it will help connect you to other developers, learn from some, mentor others and become a better engineer.

You'll be able to create a profile that displays preferred languages, web frameworks, mobile platforms, cloud providers, CI tools, any kind of skill that you think is relevant to you a developer. You can also talk about non-technical skills, workplace preferences and anything else that helps tell a clear story about what a you have done, what you're capable of doing and how you want to grow.

Fizbuz is for developers, by developers.
