# Fizbuz

Fizbuz helps developers create a profile that displays preferred languages, web frameworks, mobile platforms, cloud providers, CI tools, any kind of skill that you think is relevant to the work you do as a developer. You can also talk about non-technical skills, workplace preferences and anything else that helps tell a clear story about what a you have done, what you're capable of doing and how you want to grow. Think of Fizbuz as a replacement for a PDF resume or a LinkedIn profile.

Fizbuz is for developers, by developers.

## Code of Conduct

Participating in the Fizbuz community (here on Github, on Slack, etc) requires you to abide by our [Code of Conduct](/code-of-coduct.md).

## Docs

Part of building Fizbuz involves creating highly structured data types that helps turn what is often free-form resume writing into a structured and semanticly interesting document that both humans and machine can quickly reason about. 

Part of building Fizbuz will involve building a comprehensive taxonomy of technical and non-technical skills. Everything from Bash to Erlang to Terraform. We hope to crowd-source much of this information via easy-to-use web interfaces.

But we also want to give back, and will be making the data available both on the web and via REST and GraphQL APIs. You can read more about these efforts in our [Docs](/docs/).
