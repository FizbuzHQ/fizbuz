# Code of Conduct

Everyone is required to agree to and follow this Code of Conduct. Inappropriate behavior or harassment of any kind is not tolerated and violaters will be removed from the community.

This is a NO RECRUITER and NO RECRUITING zone. This is a safe place for developers to gather and learn from one another. Please refrain from advertising your company or your job openings here. 

This is a NO LURKER zone. Community members are required to provide the following minimum bits of information: full name, current place of work and job title. A link to a LinkedIn profile or other website is fine if it includes this information. It's important for everyone to understand clearly who they are talking to. 

Discouraged behaviors include: directly DM-ing people. Please try and conduct all conversation in the open. It helps us all learn. If a comment must be private, please ask if it's OK to DM them. Only DM people if you are positive that it is welcome. 

Unacceptable behaviors include: intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning speech or actions by any participant. This includes in our Discord community online, at all related events, and in one-on-one communications carried out in the context of community business. 

The Fizbuz Discord community is dedicated to providing a harassment-free space for developers regardless of gender identity, sex, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, physical appearance, or body size. Harassment includes: prejudicial verbal or written comments, sexual imagery or inappropriate use of nudity, deliberate intimidation, stalking or following, sustained disruption of conversation and unwelcome sexual attention.

Finally, anything that would make someone think "Hmmm, that's inappropriate" may also be unacceptable behavior.

Any community member asked to stop any harassing behavior is expected to comply immediately. 

# Reporting

If you feel uncomfortable, are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact @carter or email carter@fizbuz.com immediately. 

# Enforcement

If a community member is asked to stop harassing or inappropriate behavior, they are expected to do so immediately. If a community member engages in harassing behavior, the moderators may take any action they deem appropriate; this may include warning the person, immediate removal from the Discord community, and/or banning from any future gatherings and events. 

Our foremost concern is the safety and comfort of all our community members. We will evaluate any possible sanctions with regard to whether or not they provide the safety needed.
